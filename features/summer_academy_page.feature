Feature: Summer Academy
    As a Web Designer
    I would like to test my CSS
    
Scenario: CSS
    Given I am no "summer academy" page
    Then I should see "harmony_logo"
    And I should see "background" to be "white"
    Then the "harmony_logo " should have "margin" of "1.5em"
    Then the "UC Berkeley Hass Business School" should have "margin" of "2.5em"
    Then the "Course benefit" should have "margin" of "2.5em"
    Then the "B-Bay" should have "margin" of "2.5em"
    Then the "IDEAL" should have "margin" of "2.5em"
    And I should see "stories"
    And I should see "contact"
    And I should see "B-Bay"
    And I should see "IDEAL"
